## Assistant Meeting Manager Application

The *Assistant Meeting Manager* will help an individual organize all the logistics for a future meeting. Currently, the
*Assistant Meeting Manager* considers and supports the following features when booking a room:  
- room capacity 
- room functions (ex: Skype for Business, whiteboard, TV)
- technological support (ex: set up Skype)
- catering (servings based on diet restrictions)

    This application is intended for the use of companies whose offices facilitate recurring internal and external meetings.
The Assistant Meeting Manager can alleviate the responsibility of having to organize multiple meetings for Executive
Assistants or Receptionists alike. 

    Working seasonally as a receptionist myself, I recognized the repetitive and mundane nature of organizing meetings, 
a task often involving extensive back and forth communication with the host. Designing an interface for employees to 
manually select all their desired meeting features would eliminate any miscommunication and provide instant confirmation 
if such a room is available. This application would provide a simple application for employees to book meetings and 
expedite the booking process.
