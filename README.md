Whether you are a university student managing their school-day, a working professional balancing endless numbers  
of meetings or a stay-at-home parent frantically juggling all their kids' extra-curriculars; the Day Planner Assistant
is perfect for anyone looking to efficiently organize and record the events and/or activities in store for the day.
As a university student myself, I find it difficult keeping track of my class schedule along with pending assignment
deadlines or club meetings and other errands. An application such as the Day Planner Assistant would allow me to 
keep an organized record and track different activities or events I have that day along with necessary details such
as the date and time, location, as well as a reminder.
